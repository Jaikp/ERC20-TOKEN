## Features

- Standard ERC20 token implementation
- Transfer tokens between accounts
- Approve and transfer tokens on behalf of another account
- Query balances and allowances

## Installation

To get started with Vyom, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vyom-token.git
   cd vyom-token
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) installed.

## Deployment

### Deploying to Holesky Testnet

1. Update your `hardhat.config.js` with the Holesky network configuration:

   ```javascript
   require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');
   require('dotenv').config();

   module.exports = {
     solidity: "0.8.0",
     networks: {
       holesky: {
         url: `https://your.holesky.rpc.url`,
         accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
       },
     },
   };
   ```

2. Deploy the contract:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network holesky
   ```

3. Note the deployed token address in the console output.

## Usage

Once deployed, you can interact with the Vyom token contract using your preferred Ethereum wallet or a web interface that supports ERC20 tokens. 

### Example Interactions

- **Transfer Tokens**

```javascript
const vyomToken = await ethers.getContractAt("Vyom", tokenAddress);
await vyomToken.transfer("recipient_address", amount);
```

- **Check Balance**

```javascript
const balance = await vyomToken.balanceOf("your_address");
console.log(`Your balance: ${ethers.utils.formatEther(balance)}`);
```

## Contract Functions

The Vyom token contract includes the following functions:

- `transfer(address to, uint256 amount)`: Transfers `amount` tokens to `to` address.
- `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`: Approves `spender` to spend `amount` tokens on behalf of the caller.
- `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount)`: Transfers `amount` tokens from `from` to `to`.
- `balanceOf(address owner)`: Returns the balance of `owner`.

## Testing

To run tests for the Vyom token, use the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

Ensure that you have a local Ethereum network running (or use the Hardhat network) for testing.
